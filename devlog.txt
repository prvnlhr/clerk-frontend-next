First give me the flow with  node code.
Explain me like below,

Job-seeker visits the sign-up page -> '/auth/user/sign-up
fill details like,
first name, 
last name,
email,
phone,
password, confirm password,

data goes to service layer function. service layer function makes the fetch api call to backend -> '/api/auth/..'
At backend nodejs checks the credentials.....
